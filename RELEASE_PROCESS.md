# Manual Release Process Guide

This document describes the step-by-step manual release process for tash using AI assistance to analyze commits, generate release notes, and trigger the GitHub Actions workflow via opencode (with `gh` CLI integration).

## Overview

The manual release process involves:

1. **AI-driven commit analysis** - Analyze commit history since last release
2. **AI-generated release notes** following strict formatting conventions
3. **Preview and review** - release notes shown before any actions taken
4. **Human review and approval** for quality control
5. **Workflow dispatch** - trigger GitHub Actions via `gh` CLI
6. **Automated build and release** - existing workflow handles build, sign, notarize, and publish

## Prerequisites

- [opencode](https://opencode.ai/) installed
- [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com) installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`)
- Understanding of conventional commit patterns
- Familiarity with major.minor versioning (no patch versions)

## AI-Assisted Release Process

Use this prompt in opencode to handle the entire release process:

### Master Release Prompt

```
I need to create a new release for tash. Please:

STEP 1: ANALYZE COMMITS
- Use `gh` CLI or available tools to get the latest release tag
- Fetch all commits between that tag and current HEAD
- Analyze each commit for user-facing changes

STEP 2: GENERATE RELEASE NOTES
Create structured release notes with this EXACT format:

### Breaking Changes
[Only if breaking changes exist - triggers major version]
- Description focusing on user impact (abc1234)

### New Features
- Feature description emphasizing user benefit (abc1234)

### Improvements  
- Improvement description with user impact (abc1234)

### Bug Fixes
- Fix description focusing on resolved user issue (abc1234)

REQUIREMENTS:
- Focus ONLY on user-facing changes and impact
- EXCLUDE: docs, build, ci, chore, refactor, test commits  
- Use active voice, present tense
- Include commit short hashes (GitHub renders as links)
- Version logic: major.minor format only (no patch)
  - MINOR version (1.1 → 1.2): New features, bug fixes, improvements
  - MAJOR version (1.2 → 2.0): Breaking changes detected
- Show this preview BEFORE any actions

STEP 3: SHOW PREVIEW
Display the generated release notes and ask for approval before proceeding.

STEP 4: TRIGGER WORKFLOW (after approval)
Use `gh workflow run` to trigger the "Build and Release" workflow:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml \
  -f release_tag="v[VERSION]" \
  -f release_notes="[generated content]" \
  -f draft=true \
  -f prerelease=false
```

Please start with Step 1 - analyze the commits and show me the preview.
```

## How It Works

opencode will:
1. **Analyze commits** since last release via `gh` CLI
2. **Generate release notes** with proper formatting and categorization  
3. **Show preview** and ask for approval
4. **Trigger GitHub Actions workflow** with the release notes
5. **GoReleaser** builds cross-platform binaries (darwin + linux, amd64 + arm64), signs and notarizes macOS binaries, and publishes the GitHub Release

## Features

- **Automatic filtering** of technical commits (docs, tests, CI, etc.)
- **User-focused** release notes with clear impact descriptions
- **Smart versioning** - minor for features/fixes, major for breaking changes
- **Preview before action** - human approval required
- **Cross-platform binaries** - GoReleaser produces signed binaries for all supported platforms

## Troubleshooting

- **gh CLI issues**: Run `gh auth status` to verify authentication
- **Workflow dispatch failed**: Check repository permissions for workflow dispatch
- **Invalid release notes**: Review format requirements and regenerate
- **Signing fails**: Verify `MACOS_SIGN_P12`, `MACOS_SIGN_PASSWORD`, `MACOS_NOTARY_ISSUER_ID`, `MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ID`, and `MACOS_NOTARY_KEY` secrets are configured in the repository
